# AI Learning Game

A strategic grid-based game where you compete against an AI that learns from your moves and becomes smarter over time.

## 🎮 Game Overview

The AI Learning Game is an 8x8 grid-based strategy game where you play against an AI opponent. Both players move around the board collecting valuable items while avoiding traps and obstacles. The unique feature is that the AI learns from your playing patterns and becomes increasingly challenging as you play more games.

## 🎯 Objective

Collect more points than the AI by gathering Gold and Silver items while avoiding Traps. The game ends when all valuable items are collected or the move limit is reached.

## 🕹️ How to Play

### Controls
- **Arrow Buttons**: Use the directional buttons (↑ ↓ ← →) to move your player (P) around the board
- **New Game**: Start a fresh game with a new board layout
- **Train AI**: Run 10 automated training games to make the AI smarter
- **Auto Play**: Watch the game play automatically
- **End Game**: Manually end the current game

### Game Elements

| Symbol | Item | Points | Description |
|--------|------|--------|-------------|
| P | Player | - | Your character (green) |
| AI | AI | - | AI opponent (red) |
| G | Gold | +5 | High-value collectible |
| S | Silver | +3 | Medium-value collectible |
| T | Trap | -2 | Penalty item to avoid |
| ■ | Obstacle | - | Impassable barrier |

### Scoring System
- **Gold (G)**: +5 points
- **Silver (S)**: +3 points  
- **Trap (T)**: -2 points
- **Empty spaces**: 0 points

## 🧠 AI Learning System

The AI uses several learning mechanisms:

### 1. Pattern Recognition
- Tracks your movement patterns based on board positions
- Predicts your next moves based on historical data
- Adapts strategy to counter your typical behavior

### 2. Experience-Based Learning
- Starts with random exploration (first 5 games)
- Develops strategic preferences through training
- Builds knowledge database of successful moves

### 3. Competitive Strategy
- Evaluates moves based on immediate rewards
- Considers proximity to valuable items
- Attempts to compete for the same resources as the player

### Learning Levels
- **Beginner**: Random movements, no strategy
- **Learning**: Basic pattern recognition
- **Intermediate**: Strategic item collection
- **Advanced**: Predictive player behavior
- **Expert**: Full strategic AI with learned patterns

## 🎲 Game Features

### Statistics Tracking
- **Player Score**: Your current game score
- **AI Score**: AI's current game score  
- **Games Played**: Total number of training sessions completed
- **AI Learning Progress**: Visual progress bar showing AI development

### Game Status Display
- Current move count vs maximum moves (100)
- Number of valuable items remaining
- Game over conditions and winner announcement

### Training Mode
The "Train AI" feature runs 10 automated games where both you and the AI play with random moves. This allows the AI to:
- Build up its knowledge database
- Learn different board configurations
- Develop strategic preferences
- Improve decision-making algorithms

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Open the HTML file** in any modern web browser
2. **Click "New Game"** to start your first match
3. **Use arrow buttons** to move around the board
4. **Collect Gold and Silver** while avoiding Traps
5. **Train the AI** periodically to increase difficulty
6. **Watch your strategy evolve** as you learn the AI's patterns

## 💡 Strategy Tips

### For Players
- **Prioritize Gold items** (5 points) over Silver (3 points)
- **Avoid Traps** as they give negative points
- **Block the AI** from reaching high-value items when possible
- **Learn the AI's patterns** and use them to your advantage

### Understanding AI Behavior
- **Early games**: AI moves randomly
- **After training**: AI becomes more strategic
- **Advanced AI**: Predicts your moves and competes directly
- **Expert AI**: Uses complex evaluation of board states

## 🔧 Technical Features

- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices
- **Visual Effects**: Smooth animations and modern UI
- **Real-time Learning**: AI updates its knowledge after each move
- **Game Logging**: Detailed move history and game events
- **State Management**: No data persistence required (runs entirely in browser)

## 🎨 Visual Design

- **Modern gradient background** with glassmorphism effects
- **Color-coded game elements** for easy identification
- **Smooth animations** and hover effects
- **Responsive grid layout** that adapts to screen size
- **Progress indicators** for AI learning development

## 🔄 Game End Conditions

The game ends when:
1. **All valuable items collected** (Gold and Silver)
2. **Move limit reached** (100 total moves)
3. **Manual game end** (using End Game button)

## 📊 Performance Notes

- **Lightweight**: Runs entirely in the browser with no external dependencies
- **Fast**: Optimized rendering and AI calculations
- **Memory efficient**: Uses in-memory storage only
- **Cross-platform**: Compatible with all modern browsers

## 🤖 AI Implementation Details

The AI uses a hybrid approach combining:
- **Immediate reward calculation** for move evaluation
- **Pattern matching** for player behavior prediction
- **Strategic positioning** relative to valuable items
- **Competitive analysis** to block player advantages

## 🎯 Future Enhancements

Potential improvements could include:
- Different difficulty levels
- Larger board sizes
- Additional item types
- Multiplayer support
- Move history analysis
- AI personality modes
